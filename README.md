**Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Submission**

This is the final project submission for Johns Hopkins University's Getting and Cleaning Data course.

**Project Parameters**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to gather, manipulate and clean data by developing an R script that meets the following requirements:

1. Training and the test data sets are merged to create a single data set.

2. The data set extracts only the mean and standard deviation measurements from a larger measurement data set. 

3. The data set uses descriptive activity names in lieu of the numeric values that are included in the original data set.

4. The data set is labeled with descriptive variable names. 

5. A second, independent tidy data set is created that summarizes the average of each measurement by subject and activity.
